LangChain, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This repository presents an intelligent E-commerce Chatbot designed to assist customers by answering product queries, 
providing recommendations, and supporting order management. The system leverages LangChain to orchestrate large language models (LLMs)
and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch relevant information from a structured product database or knowledge base in real-time.

### [Medical Image Segmentation (ISIC-17)](https://github.com/Rafi3690/ISIC-2017-Segmentation)

Python, opencv, PyTorch

The ISIC-17 dataset provides high-resolution dermoscopic images for skin lesion segmentation, 
aiming to accurately delineate lesion boundaries. This project employs deep learning segmentation models.

### [Breast Cancer Prediction Using Pycaret](https://github.com/Rafi3690/Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Useing-Pycaret)

Breast cancer prediction involves analyzing medical data (e.g., tumor characteristics, biopsies) to predict whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). 
Machine learning models can be used to automate this process, offering faster and more accurate diagnostics. PyCaret, an open-source machine learning library in Python, simplifies 
the process of model training, evaluation, and deployment, making it an excellent choice for predicting breast cancer from a dataset.

### [Medical Assistant Chatbot Using Langchain](https://github.com/Rafi3690/Chatbot-Development)
A Medical Assistant Chatbot providing accurate, context-aware healthcare responses using LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). 
It retrieves relevant medical information from documents or databases and generates evidence-based answers for patient queries efficiently and reliably.

<!--### [🙂 Face detection and recognition using yolov8 facenet](https://github.com/m4hfuj/FaceStream/tree/version-6)

This Python project processes live video from a webcam or YouTube stream, detecting 
faces and applying filters in real time. It uses YOLOv8 for face detection,
InceptionResnetV1 (Facenet) for recognition, and Mediapipe for accurate landmark 
mapping. With an intuitive PyQt5 interface, users can input YouTube links, 
upload photos, and save recognized faces, enabling a seamless and interactive 
experience.

<!--### [🔎 Bangladeshi tech job data analysis from bdjobs](https://github.com/m4hfuj/bangladeshi-tech-job-query)

This project automates the collection of technical job data from BD Jobs using 
web scraping and stores it in a MySQL database. Job fields are classified using 
LLM-based text classification, while educational requirements, programming 
languages, and packages are identified using regular expressions. A dashboard 
visualizes the top 10 educational requirements, programming languages, and 
packages, with filtering options by job field.

<!-- ### [Project 4: 🤖 Fine-tuning microsoft phi-2 model on medicine data](https://github.com/m4hfuj/Large-Language-Models/blob/main/Fine%20Tuning%20microsoft%20phi-2%20on%20medicine%20dataset.ipynb)

Fine-tuned the Microsoft Phi-2 model on medical data by adapting its pre-trained 
capabilities to domain-specific tasks like medical text classification and summarization. 
This allowed me to enhance the model's performance, leveraging its advanced natural 
language understanding for healthcare applications, allowing it to generate recommended 
medicine details based on disease symptoms. -->




<!--## 🧮 Machine Learning / Deep Learning 

I have spent a lot of time diving deep into various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, 
learning both the theory behind them and how to implement them in code. This 
blend of knowledge has given me the ability to not only use these algorithms 
effectively but also tweak and adapt them to solve specific problems. Here is a 
list of the machine learning algorithms and techniques I am familiar with, 
highlighting the range of skills I have developed in this area.
